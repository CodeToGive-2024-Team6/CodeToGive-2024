**Made with JavaScript and hosted on Firebase & Glitch!**

>[!NOTE]
>This website is currently in beta and bugs will be a-plenty! Please report bugs if you find any!

>[!TIP]
>You can access the deployed website at [website URL here](https://google.com) or follow the following instructions to build and deploy it yourself.

Clone the repo locally to your machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/CodeToGive-2024-Team6/CodeToGive-2024
```

Then install all packages and necessary files with npm from the frontend folder:
```
npm install
```

Once all necessary files are downloaded, you can run the website yourself using npm:
```
npm run dev
```

Alternatively, to deploy and test it elsewhere you can:
```
npm run build
```
